# Features
### Dynamic Donation Details Page:
- This feature allows users to click on a donation card on the home page and be redirected to a dynamic Donation Details page.
- The Donation Details page displays detailed information about the selected donation, including a picture, title, description, and a donate button with the price.
- When the user clicks the Donate button, a toast or sweet alert is displayed with a meaningful success message.

### Pie Chart in the Statistics Page:
- The Statistics page includes a pie chart that visually represents the user's donations as a percentage of the total donations.
- This pie chart is dynamically generated based on the user's donation data, showcasing their contribution relative to the overall donations.

### Search Functionality:
- The search bar feature allows users to input categories to search for specific donations on the homepage.
- When a category is entered, clicking the search button filters and displays only the donations that match the specified category.
